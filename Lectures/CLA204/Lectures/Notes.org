   - Geek has no history, it is all oral passdowns
   - Geek history is around ~3000 to ~1100 did not exist. They did not call them selves Greek. We do not know that they are called. Since 1900 we have started calling them Minoans.
   - Evans discovered the civilization found many records, all which were un readable to this day. 
   - Minoans are very well known for their king Minos.
   - They did well for themselves during the bronze age.
   - Myceneans (Thats what we call them) probably called themselved Achaiol.

   - All sources indicate things went wrong for everyone (including the Myceneans) by a new maurauding group. 
   - Pylos was burned to the ground, we know this because records were burned into clay.
   - Only one civilization withstood the attacks, not defeating them, but a settle ment. The Egyptians called them the "Sea Peoples".
   - The Sea Peoples made a mess of things
   - By 1100 - 1000BCE Myceneans were decimated.
   - This era is called the Mycenean Twillight
   - These poeple had not interest in record keeping, for the next 250 years, there are no reccords.

** Creation Myth
   - We see the creation of the cosmos, maybe something more.
   - Espabilishes something about a world Axis. 
   - Everytime we organize a World Axis, we come closer to the divine. 
   - Some cultures still belive this, Greek culture thought everything had divine relevance. 
   - First type of creation myth \rightarrow nihilo (Out of nothing)
   - A diety created the cosmos via word, thought, dream, or some kind of activity, but is a single entity who des it.
   - Seccond type of creation myth \rightarrow Earth Diver
   - The creator is less involved
   - Sends some kind of being into the primordial state (water, etc) and this being starts the creation process
   - This some kind of thing in the universe wherein the creator makes something strat the process.
   - Third type \rightarrow Emergence type
   - Science Fiction
   - A being or beings come from other realms then reach the present one where in we dwell and they take their knowledge to create a new universe.
   - Gradual Process
   - Fourth Type \rightarrow Creation by disembodiement
   - Creator being wh has a vast endless body.
   - From this body, they remove pieces from themselves to create the universe
   - It is all contained within them
   - Fifth Type \rightarrow Creaking-Up
   - There is an original Chaos, where in things start to emerge, but also start to breakup.
   - Combining emergence with disembodiment
   - Sometimes that breakup is active (use of sex act)
   - Sometimes is it litteral and passive wherein the entity start dividing itself into pieces.
   - Herold and his epic
   - Most are a complete and fill rendition of the Greek creation story. 
   - \frac{1}{2} of the real sources we have for myth
   - Ordify Greek culture.
   - Story as opposed to a synopsis
   - Herold composedit - somewhere in the 8^th century wherein writing was first starting to get underway
   - We don't know if he was litterate or an oral poet
   - He is the first individual to emerge from Greek liturature.
   - He names himself
   - The theogony is a gold mine of mythological details of the generation of the Gods.
   - Takes traditional tales that has been trasmitted orally from a variety of places.
   - The Gods are chiefly Greek, however some of the story and prefix is actually fimilliar to the sonfs from the near East.
   - 2700 years later, it came down to us to determine it was an authoritative test.
   - There are other theogonys we are told, with several differences, so we study the creation of the cosomos as Hesis saw it. 
   - The first generation of Gods are rather abstract in their contempcies (the areas they has control)
   - As we move to the Olympian Era, the Gods are most more speciailized.
   - Moving from elemental to human depictions
   - Gods become far more anthropomorphic
   - The Gods in Hesis narrative have polyvalent (Many forms of reference)
   - We have to understant the Gods are, and participate in the universe. 
   - In the beginnning, according to Hesis, there was Chaos (In ancient Greek, litterally means a yawning, a gaping)
   - The apcae wherein potential can be actuallized
   - The implication is that it is something, but it is not something (Like zero)
   - Chaos comes from the very Chano, I yawn.
   - Hesis says that Chaos came first.
   - Then, Gala (and other titans) emerge
   - We do not know if they comes from chaos or if they simple emerge.
   - Gala, or Ge, is the earth
   - She is a pysical entity, as opposed to spacial.
   - Then emerges Tartaros is the darkest, deepesst, part of the underworld.
   - This titan is very comprehensable. Since we have a very specific idea of where the universe sits. He is not attached to Gala, but is the bottom half.
   - Eros, emerges, the entitiy wherein the sexual impulse is experienced. 
   - Primary deity, after Eros, sexual reproduction becomes the standard means
   - Not sexual act, but the sexual impulse. 
   - Nyx, is next to emerge, representing the night.
   - Erebos, also emerges, representing darkness. 
   - Not the darkness at 3am, more like going in the closet with the door shut and all night removed. It is complete darkness.
   - Nyx and Erebos create Hemera and Aither (Day, and the brightness of day)
   - This sexual act occurs in cycle, creating day and night to this day
   - Gala created Ouranos above her, and Pontos below her. 
   - Gala also produces monsters
   - Group One \rightarrow Cyclopes, and Hekatoncheires.
   - Cyclopse (Round eye, 1 enormous eye in their head.)
   - Hekatoncheres (The hundread handed ones)
   - These reprsents the preternatural (Beyond natural, do not occur in nature) They represent the potential forces in nature
   - Lastly, Gigantes, a gitant. 
   - These 3 monsters are not nessearly evil or bad, they are just obnormal.
   - Now Gala mates with Ouranos (Earth and Sky) it becomes known as the Heros Hanos (The sacred marrage)
   - They produce 12 children, the first generation of Anthrpormorphic Gods, *The titans*

** The Titans
   - These entities are moving into a more anthroprmorhic shape. 
   - This new generation is taking a more defined form. 
   - Ouranos does not allow the children to be born, he physically pushes them back into Gala. (Burying them in the Earth)
   - The new children represent a thread to Ouranos
   - So Gala gives bith no another child, a keeps council with Kronos. 
   - Kronos decides the only way to castrated with a sickle.

   - This child is known today as Zeus. 
   - He is hidden in a cave
   - Amalthea and Melisa are Zeus' 2 adopted moms. (meaning the tender godess, a goat, Melisa is a bee.) This gives the 2 requirements milk and honey.
   - Kronos vomits a stone he inhaled from his mother, causing all of his siblings to be vomited by his mother to aid him. They became known as the children on the titans, the Olympians.
